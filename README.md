## Instructions to Run

For postorder traversal,

```
$ make postorder
```

For preorder traversal,

```
$ make preorder
```

For vertex level,

```
$ make vertex_level
```

## Notes

- The time complexity of taking inputs and printing results is not considered for the total time complexity. The algorithms each take **O(logn)** time.
- The input is currently hard-coded.
- Hashing has been used in a few places for ease of implementation without loss of program correctness.
- Euler tour is generated and printed in each of the traversals. There is no separate command to invoke Euler tour.
